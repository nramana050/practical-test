Set up Git Repository: If you're familiar with Git, initialize a repository locally
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use Terraform to define the AWS resources needed for the deployment. You'll need to create resources for ECS or EKS, a load balancer.
Docker Configuration: Write a Dockerfile to containerize your application. Use a base image for Node.js and configure it to inject the SECRET_WORD environment variable.
Deploy to AWS: Utilize the infrastructure you defined in Terraform to deploy your Dockerized application to AWS ECS or EKS.
Load Balancer Setup: Configure a load balancer (such as an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer) to distribute incoming traffic to your container instances.
TLS Configuration: Generate SSL certificates and configure HTTPS for your load balancer to enable secure communication.
GitHub Actions: Create GitHub Actions workflows to automate the deployment process whenever changes are pushed to your repository.



sudo docker run -e SECRET_WORD=$(curl -s http://<ip_or_host>[:port]/) -p 3000:3000  image_name

Generate Self-Signed SSL Certificates

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

Configure Load Balancer:
Assuming you're using AWS, you'll configure your Application Load Balancer (ALB) to terminate SSL connections.

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.
Select "Load Balancers" from the navigation pane.
Choose your ALB and click on its name.
Under the "Listeners" tab, add a new listener.
Set the protocol to HTTPS (443).
Choose the SSL certificate (either upload the self-signed certificate or select an existing one).
Configure the default action to forward traffic to your target group.
3. Redirect HTTP Traffic to HTTPS:
You'll want to ensure that all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS for security.

Still in the ALB configuration, under the "Listeners" tab, edit the existing HTTP listener (port 80).
Add a redirect action:
Choose "Redirect" as the action type.
Set the protocol to HTTPS (443).
Enable the option for "Redirect to hostname"
